# Global Salary Trends-Tableau
This repo contains all the datasets and information related to my Global Salary Trends Project.

•	Developed a new Tableau dashboard as a part of an academic project to enable the end user to understand compensation structures and make data-driven decisions by visualizing global salary trends based on location, experience, job title, and employment type.

•	The dashboard provides insights into salary distribution, experience and company size variations, remote work opportunities, and average salary for different roles and employment types.
